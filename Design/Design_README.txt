Put any sort of ideas, design concepts, flow diagrams, etc. for the app here! Code shouldn't go here, just overall architecture.

    5) git push origin master

CHANGES ON MARCH 5:
===================

I made some changes to the android skeleton to allow easier individual development of our first tasks before we put it together. I created a seperate activity for each of us, so work within your own activity for now (YournameActivity).

Before you start making any changes, do the following so that all of our files are up to date:

    - In your returnJump folder, remove the spoilFoil directory (you may also have to remove .metadata if you get an error in the next step)

    - In terminal, enter step 4 of the above GITHUB TIPS

    - You should now be up to date
